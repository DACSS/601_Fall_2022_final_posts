About 200 countries. Many laws with a million asterisks next to them.\n\nEach country handles citizenship and immigration differently. Some countries permit dual citizenship, while others restrict how many nationalities their citizens can have. Some countries give unconditional citizenship to any child born on their soil, while others do if their parents are citizens. Finally, there are countries that only restrict the path to citizenship to certain races, ethnic, or religious groups.\n\nA citizenship is a contract between the citizen and the country. The citizen pledges allegiance to the country (or countries); and in turn, the country (or countries) provide rights and protections for the citizen. For example, I am a dual American-Lebanese citizen; I was born in America, which provides unconditional birthright citizenship, and my parents passed the Lebanese nationality down to my sisters and me. The allegiance between the citizen and the country can break, just like a contract. In several cases, the citizenship can be revoked, from voluntary renunciation of a citizenship or involuntary renunciation due to disloyalty, criminal offenses, or even having dual citizenship. Note the word “several” since the situation like this is on a case-by-case analysis. Out of curiosity and interest, the purpose of this report is to analyze the bureaucratic nature of citizenship and immigration.\n\nQuestion: Which countries have more lax citizenship laws, and which countries have more restrictive citizenship laws?\n\n## Open Dataset\n\nThe dataset, which is called GLOBALCIT Citizenship Law Dataset, originates from Italy-based European University Institute, specifically at the Cadmus EUI Research Repository. Maarten Peter Link et. al., from the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies collected data on different ways citizenship can be acquired or loss in each country as of 2020. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# citizenship laws by country\ncitizenship <- read.csv(\"_data/GLOBALCIT Citizenship Law v1 EUI ResData/Data/data_v1.0_country-year.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open file '_data/GLOBALCIT Citizenship Law\nv1 EUI ResData/Data/data_v1.0_country-year.csv': No such file or directory\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitizenship\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'citizenship' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(citizenship)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'citizenship' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are three datasets; one dataset about citizenship acquisition, another dataset about loss of citizenship; and a mega dataset containing both laws. Trying to merge the two former datasets would be like reinventing the wheel, so I opted to analyze the mega dataset, which consisted of 104 columns and 190 rows. Each row lists the country in the order of their country code in the Italian language. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(citizenship)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(x): object 'citizenship' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo make this report easier for the reader, as well as myself, I will be broadly focusing on whether the citizenship laws are enforced, regardless of the exceptions in place. For example, if a country allows parents to pass down citizenship to their children, I will classify that as “yes”, even if there’s an age limit to receiving citizenship, or if a country allows dual citizenship with certain countries, I will classify that as “Yes” as in they allow dual citizenship. However, I will keep the original dataset to manipulate more variables later.\n\n## Tidy and Manipulate Dataset\n\nThis is an extremely messy dataset, so with `mutate()` and `case_when()`, I reorganize and recode the variables according to the code guide provided in the ZIP file. The A stands for \"acquisition\", as in \"how citizenship is acquired\", and L stands for \"loss\" as in \"how citizenship is loss\". The word bin, short for binary, means if the country has the citizenship law, and cat, short for category, means what the exceptions are in the citizenship law, but I will solely focus on the binary data for now.\n\nFirst, let's recode the acquisition variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# recode laws on acquisition of citizenship\ncitizen_tidy <- citizenship %>%\n  mutate(\"acq_descborn\" = case_when(A01a_bin == 1 ~ \"Yes\",   #

In addition, the majority of the countries permit citizenship based on marriage, certain years of residency, and permit dual citizenship.\n\nIn regards to loss of citizenship, most countries let former citizen renounce their citizenship voluntary. In addition, there are laws in place that warrant a loss of citizenship for the person.

One country can be relatively open, while its neighbor is closed off to the world. \n\n## Reflection and Conclusion\n\nI had no prior experience with R before starting my masters in data analytics, and after many classes, resources, and Google searches, I must say that I did a great job on this project. Let me explain:\n\nChoosing a topic that interested me made the project more manageable. I was always interested in learning about other countries, such as cultures, laws, and societies in each country. This dataset of citizenship laws by each country is no different. I have visited 10 countries, and continue to visit more in the foreseeable future.\n\nI felt like I hit the jackpot when I stumbled upon this dataset on the database archival website Data is Plural. It was messy, tedious, and confusing to read: it was the perfect dataset to clean, manipulate, and visualize. The handy guide attached in the ZIP file was the cherry on the top. \n\nThe most challenging part of data analytics as a whole is trying to figure out which codes to use for my desired results. A map? Try a bunch of these codes (we won''t guarantee your map would look funky). Forgot to capitalize a letter? Your data doesn't exist. I have the basic idea on what I want my end results to be, but I have to spend hours looking for the right code and find the tiny problem I have been overlooking for those past hours. I give up, until I don't: the feeling of finding that one line of code is the feeling of success. \n\nHowever, I wish I learned to code earlier in my childhood. I would have caught up with the rest of the class if I had a basic idea of coding, but it's better to learn now than never. I'm in the middle of my career change from marketing to data analytics, which permits me to work behind the scene. \n\nOverall, the world is not our oyster and we must follow the laws wherever we go. It is always ideal to do research beforehand or hire an immigration lawyer. \n\n## Resources\n\nCookbook for R, http://www.cookbook-r.com/. \n\nGrolemund, Hadley Wickham and Garrett.
