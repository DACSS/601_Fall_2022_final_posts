The MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on the Grade 10 Math MCAS test \"predict longer-term educational attainments and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student advantage. For example, among\ndemographically similar students who attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores.\" (Papay et. al, 2020 pp 7-10)\n\n\nIn this report, I will analyze the Spring 2022 MCAS Results for students completing the High School Introductory Physics MCAS at [Rising Tide Charter Public School](https://risingtide.org/).\n\nThe `MCAS_2022` data frame contains performance results from 495 students from \nRising Tide on the Spring 2022 \n[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)](https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/default.html) \ntests.\n\nFor each student, there are values reported for 256 different variables which \nconsist of information from four broad categories\n\n\n- *Demographic characteristics* of \nthe students themselves (e.g., race, gender, date of birth, town, grade level, \nyears in school, years in Massachusetts, and low income, title1, IEP, 504, \nand EL status ). \n\n- *Key assessment features* including subject, test format, and\naccommodations provided \n\n\n\n- *Performance metrics*: This includes a student's score on individual item strands, \ne.g.,`sitem1`-`sitem42`. \n\nSee the `MCAS_2022` data frame summary and __codebook__ in the __appendix__ for further details.\n \n\nThe second data set, `SG9_Item`, is $42 \\times 9$ and consists of \n9 variables with information pertaining to the 42 questions on the 2022 [HS Introductory Physics Item Report](https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/mcas/mcasitems2.aspx?grade=HS&subjectcode=PHY&linkid=23&orgcode=04830000&fycode=2022&orgtypecode=5&). The variables can be broken down into 2 categories:\n\n Details about the content of a given test item: \n \n This includes the content `Reporting Category` (MF (motion and forces)\nWA (waves), and EN (energy)), the `Standard` from the [2016 STE Massachusetts Curriculum Framework](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf), the `Item Description` providing the details of what specifically was asked of students, and the points \navailable for a given question, `item Possible Points`.\n\nSummary Performance Metrics:\n\n- For each item, the state reports the percentage of points earned by students at \nRising Tide, `RT Percent Points`, the percentage of available points earned by students\nin the state, `State Percent Points`, and the difference between the percentage of points earned by Rising Tide students and the percentage of points earned by students in the state, `RT-State Diff`.\n\n- Lastly, `SG9_CU306Dis` and `SG9_CU306NonDis` are $3 \\times 5$ dataframes consisting of summary performance data by `Reporting Category` for students with disabilities and without disabilities; most importantly including `RT Percent Points` and `State Percent Points`by disability status.\n\n\nWhen considering our student performance data, we hope to address the following broad questions:\n\n<style>\ndiv.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}\n</style>\n<div class = \"blue\">\n\n- What adjustments (if any) should be made at the Tier 1 level, i.e., curricular adjustments \nfor all students in the General Education setting?\n\n- What would be the most beneficial areas of focus for a targeted intervention course for \nstudents struggling to meet or exceed performance expectations?\n\n- Are there notable differences in student performance for students with and without disabilities?\n</div>\n\n## Function Library\n\nTo read in, tidy, and join our data frames for each content area we will use functions. In this library. I am also drafting some functions that I would use to scale up this project. There is still work to be done here.\n\n:::panel-tabset\n### Item analysis Read in Function\n```{r}\n#Item analysis Read in Function: Input: sheet_name, subject, grade; return: student item report for

\n\n**Filter**:\n\n- _SchoolID_ : There are several variables that identify our school, I removed all\nbut one, `testschoolcode`.\n\n- _StudentPrivacy_: I left the `sasid` variable which is a student identifier number,\nbut eliminated all values corresponding to students' names.\n\n- `dis`: We are a charter school within our own unique district, therefore any \n\"district level\" data is identical to our \"school level\" data.\n\n \n__Rename__\n\nI currently have not renamed variables, but there are some trends to note:\n\n- an `e` before most `ELA` MCAS student item performance metric

To do this, I will \nselect a subset of our `MCAS_2022` data frame which includes:\n\n- 9th Grade students who took the Introductory Physics test\n- Scores on the 42 Science Items\n- points available on the\n- Performance level on the test `sperflev`.\n- Demographic characteristics of the students.\n\n\n```{r}\nSG9_MCAS_2022 <- select(MCAS_2022, contains(\"sitem\"), gender, grade, yrsinsch,\n                             race, IEP, `plan504`, sattempt, sperflev, sperf2, sscaleds)%>%\n                            filter((grade == 9) & sattempt != \"N\")\n\nSG9_MCAS_2022<-select(SG9_MCAS_2022, !(contains(\"43\")|contains(\"44\")|contains(\"45\")))\n\n\n#view(SG9_MCAS_2022)\nhead(SG9_MCAS_2022)\n\n```\n\nWhen I compared this data frame to the State reported analysis, the state analysis only contains \n68 students. Notably, my data frame has 69 entries while the state is reporting data on only 68 students. I will have to investigate this further.\n\nSince I will join this data frame with the `SG9_Item`, using `sitem` as the key, I need to pivot this data set longer.\n\n```{r}\nSG9_MCAS_2022<- pivot_longer(SG9_MCAS_2022, contains(\"sitem\"), names_to = \"sitem\", values_to = \"sitem_score\")\n\n#view(SG9_MCAS_2022)\nhead(SG9_MCAS_2022)\n\n```\n\nAs expected, we now have 42 X 69 = 2898 rows. \n\n### Join and Sanity Checks\n\nNow, we should be ready to join our data sets using `sitem` as the key. We should have a \n2,898 by (10 + 8) = 2,898 by 18 data frame. We will also check our raw data against the \nperformance data reported by the state in the item report by calculating `percent_earned` \nby Rising Tide students and comparing it to the figure `RT Percent Points` and storing the \ndifference in `earned_diff`\n```{r}\nSG9_StudentItem <- SG9_MCAS_2022 %>%\n  left_join(SG9_Item, \"sitem\")\n\n\nhead(SG9_StudentItem)\n\nSG9_StudentItem\nSG9_StudentItem%>%\n   group_by(sitem)%>%\n   summarise(percent_earned = round(sum(sitem_score, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(`item Possible Points`, na.rm=TRUE),2) )%>%\n   left_join(SG9_Item, \"sitem\")%>%\n   mutate(earned_diff = percent_earned-`RT Percent Points`)\n\n```\n\nAs expected, we now have a 2,898 X 18 data frame and the `earned_diff` values all \nround to 0.\n\n:::\n\n## G9 Science Performance Analysis\n\nNow we can examine the content of the exam itself and our students' performance relative to the state.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Structure of the Exam\n<style>\ndiv.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}\n</style>\n<div class = \"blue\">\n\nWhat reporting categories were emphasized by the state?\n\n</div>\n\n We can see from our summary that 50% of the exam points (30 of the available 60) come from questions from the Motion and Forces `Reporting Category`, followed by 30% from Energy, and 20% from Waves.\n \n\n\n```{r}\nSG9_Cat_Total<-SG9_Item%>%\n  select(`sitem`, `item Possible Points`, `Reporting Category`)%>%\n  group_by(`Reporting Category`)%>%\n  summarise(available_points = sum(`item Possible Points`, na.rm=TRUE))%>%\n  mutate(percent_available_points = available_points/(sum(available_points, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\nSG9_Cat_Total\n```\n\n```{r}\nggplot(SG9_Cat_Total, aes(x='',fill = `Reporting Category`, y = `available_points`)) +\n    geom_bar(position=\"fill\", stat = \"identity\") + coord_flip()+\n labs(subtitle =\"All Students\" ,\n       y = \"% Points Available\",\n       x= \"Reporting Category\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Exam Points Available by Reporting Category\",\n      caption = \"2022 HS Introductory Physics MCAS\")+\n       theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))\n\n\n```\n### Performance by Content Strands\n\n<style>\ndiv.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}\n</style>\n<div class = \"blue\">\n\nWhere did Rising Tide students lose most of their points? \n</div>\n\nThe proportion of points lost by Rising Tide students corresponds to the proportion of \npoints available for each `Reporting Category` of the the exam.

The performance gap between Rising Tide students and students in the state on the HS Introductroy Physics exam is accounted for by the performance of the non-disabled students in the general classroom setting.\n\nAll Rising Tide students, regardless of disability status, performed significantly weaker relative to students in the State  on items including the key word \"Calculate\" in their `item description`. This suggests that we should dedicate more classroom instructional time to problem solving with calculation. Notably, the higher a student's performance level, the higher the percentage of points a student lost for calculation items. The largest area of growth for students across all performance categories is on calculation based items; evidence based math interventions include small group, differentiated problem sets.\n\nThe discrepancy in performance by Rising Tide students with and without disabilities relative to their associated academic peers in the state, suggest that our non-disabled students would benefit from some of the practices and supports currently provided to our students on IEPs. Differentiated, tiered, small group problem sets in the general classroom setting could potentially address the \"calculation gap\".\n\n## Reflection: Limitations/Areas for Improvement\n\nI was inspired to work on this report after years of experience working at a public school. Public education is a sector that is filled with passion and positive intentions but also divisive discussions. There exist a plethora of simplistic \"one-trick fixes\" that are marketed to students, teachers, and families. The use of data is the best tool we have against pressing forward and investing our precious time and money with initiatives that do not improve student outcomes. \n\nOver the years, I've noticed that teachers and leaders are given annual data reports yet, most lack the time, capacity, or resources to identify evidence based, actionable measures to enact in the classroom or at the organizational level. When presented with all of the questions from an assessment individually and the performance of all of one's students on paper, it is difficult to identify trends. Anecdotally, I have noticed every year the majority of teachers gravitating to the scores and performance of individual students that they previously taught and ascribing mistakes or successes to specific experiences with an individual or one word in a question prompt. While relationship building and teaching to a child are hallmarks to student-teacher relationships, a narrow lens like this will not allow a teacher to identify classroom level changes or curriculum level changes that could impact all students and future students. In one's compassionate focus on individuals, a great opportunity to promote the learning for all students is lost.\n\nWith the use of R, and the MCAS reports, I decided to focus on ways to identify trends at the classroom or curricular level. I found it challenging to limit the scope of my work for this project. Also, I struggled with discerning when to use `sum` vs. when to use `averages` or `medians`. To improve a student's performance on a test, we are concerned with total points lost and relative weight of a content category; to identify curricular weaknesses we are also interested in relative performance to the state by content area.\n\nI only completed the analysis of the Introductory Physics Exam for High school students. I have `ELA`, `Math`, and `Science` results for grades 5-8 as well as grade 10. I am still working on building a general function library to generate similar graphics and tables for other content areas and grade levels and I would like to complete a similar report for each grade level and subject area assessment for teachers to use.\n\nGiven access to historical data, I think it would be beneficial to examine these trends over time to discern the performance gaps attributable to changes in the population of students (a factor which we cannot control or change) vs. those attributable to curriculum and teaching (an area we can influence and effect change).\n\nI also have access to reports that include the teacher a student had and the grades they earned from their teacher in the year they were assessed on the MCAS. I would like to examine the relationship between a student's performance as measured by their teachers compared to their performance level as measured by the state. Are their patterns to the groups of students with the largest discrepancy between these two metrics? This would be important data to support the teaching and learning at our school.\n\nOn a broader scale, I think that I need to develop a stronger sense for what summary statistics are the most meaningful for a given variable to identify potential trends or insights and subsequently what visualizations best convey these insights to a reader. I would  also like to develop a tool-kit of best practices for \"checking against my own biases\". What set of metrics can I perform to best control for my potential mistakes as a human being with a limited perspective?\n\n::: callout-note\nI did not cite the source for the MCAS Preliminary Results because it is not a publicly available data set as it contains students' personal information. I did use the raw csv. file retrievable from the DESE portal title \"MCAS Full Preliminary Results\". \n:::\n## References\n\nChang, W. (2022). *R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd Edition*.
