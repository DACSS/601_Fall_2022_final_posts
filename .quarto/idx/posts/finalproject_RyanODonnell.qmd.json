The data for this project come from Samplepalooza, an annual, one day, synoptic monitoring event throughout the entire Connecticut River Watershed. Teams of volunteers and professionals visited locations covering more than 1,000 river miles across four states. Samples are tested for the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Chloride was also included in some years.\n\nSamplepalooza is a coordinated effort led by the Connecticut River Conservancy to collect data in support of a multi-state effort working to reduce nitrogen pollution in Long Island Sound. Nitrogen from the Connecticut River and other rivers entering the Sound has been determined to be the cause of the anoxic \"dead zone\" documented by researchers in the Long Island Sound. Excess nutrients, particularly nitrogen, causes large amounts of algae to grow in the Sound. As the algae dies, it depletes the water of dissolved oxygen that is critical for aquatic wildlife. The states of Connecticut and New York have made many strides to reduce the amount of nutrients going into Long Island Sound. The upstream states find this project useful to help identify the primary areas of elevated nutrients in their watersheds to help guide their own reduction efforts.\n\nThe strategy behind Sampleplaooza is to sample a large geographic area simultaneously, ideally a day with low flows and little precipitation in all four states. This allows for more accurate comparisons to be made between samples while minimizing differences in weather and river flow variation---issues that usually complicate such studies. The project is designed to identify areas of the watershed that provide the largest sources of nutrients and, in the future, will allow for more accurate targeting of efforts to reduce nutrient impacts. Sampling locations were selected on the main stem of the Connecticut River and the downstream sections of its major tributaries.\n\n## Final Project Goals\n\nIn addition to meeting the requirements for DACSS 601, my goal with this final project is to catch up with the data analysis on all six years of Samplepalooza data. I last did a comprehensive report on the data through 2019. We have since collected two more years' of data and I owe the participants and other stakeholders a thorough look at the data collected so we can decide on the future of Samplepalooza.\n\nThe main question that needs to be answered by this data is what is the **impact** of each tributary on the watershed as a whole. When water samples are collected, the results are measured in concentrations: how much nitrogen/phosphorus/chloride is present in a liter of water. To measure the impact, we also need to know how much water there is at this concentration; this is called *loading*. To calculate loading, we multiply the concentration by the flow. We can also use the loading to calculate the *yield*, which is loading per area of land. This way we can see which tributaries are contributing the most of the measured parameter to the system by comparing the loads and which are maybe contributing more of their fair share by comparing the yields. Once the loading and yields are calculated, this can be used to direct nutrient reduction efforts within the watershed to have the most impact.\n\nThis project will start the process of developing tools that I can use moving forward to sort, clean, analyze, and store all of the data I collect at work in a more efficient way. I have spent the past few years making the same charts over and over for each river, each year in Excel and I'm ready to move beyond that!\n\n# Data\n\nThere are two main sets of data required for this analysis. The first is the **Sample Results**, which are the concentrations measured in the water samples collected by the volunteers during each Samplepalooza event. The second is the **Estimated Streamflow** that will be used to calculate loading and yield.\n\n## Sample Results\n\nSamplepalooza samples were collected annually(ish) at locations throughout the Connecticut River watershed, which encompasses parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, from the Canadian border down to Long Island Sound. It occurred in 2014-2015 and 2018-2021. Not all sites were sampled for all years. Sites were always sampled for two parameters: total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP); some years they were also sampled for chloride (Cl). It is typically done on a single day, but in 2021, severe weather caused some sites to be sampled on one day and the rest on another day. Because of this 2021 anomaly, the only date stored in this data is for 2021 and the rest just have an associated year.\n\nThis data was originally stored in a wide format with each sampling site as its own row and the columns were the site metadata and then each year-parameter combo. This was how the data came to me after 2015 and I continued using this format, but it was quickly becoming unwieldy! I have since learned that the best practice for storing and analyzing this data (and is the way required by all online databases I need to upload to) is that each individual sample should have its own row; therefore, a case is site/site info/date/parameter.\n\n```{R}\n#| label: sample data import\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| tbl-cap: Tidy Samplepalooza Results\n\n# Created from homeworks 2-3\n\nsplza_orig <- read_xlsx(\"_data/14_21SamplepaloozaResults.xlsx\",\n                        skip = 2,\n                        col_names = c(\"SiteName\", \"SiteID\", \"SiteType\", \"State\", \"EcoRegion\", \"2014-TN\", \"2015-TN\", \"2018-TN\", \"2019-TN\", \"2020-TN\", \"2021-TN\", \"2014-TP\", \"2015-TP\", \"2018-TP\", \"2019-TP\", \"2020-TP\", \"2021-TP\", \"2014-Cl\", \"2015-Cl\", \"2020-Cl\", \"2021-Cl\", \"Date2021\",\"Lat\", \"Lon\"))\n\n# step 1 - recode chloride data \n# step 2 - convert column types\n# step 3 - pivot data and relocate new columns\n# step 4 - add sample date and result unit columns\n# step 5 - remove 2021Date column\n\nsplza_tidy <- splza_orig %>%\n  mutate(`2014-Cl` = recode(`2014-Cl`, \"<3\" = \"1.5\", \"< 3\" = \"1.5\"),\n         `2015-Cl` = recode(`2015-Cl`, \"<3\" = \"1.5\", \"< 3\" = \"1.5\"),\n         `2021-Cl` = recode(`2021-Cl`, \"<3\" = \"1.5\", \"< 3\" = \"1.5\"),\n         .keep = \"all\") %>%\n  type_convert() %>%\n  pivot_longer(col = starts_with(\"20\"),\n               names_to = c(\"Year\", \"Parameter\"),\n               names_sep = \"-\",\n               values_to = \"ResultValue\",\n               values_drop_na = TRUE,\n               ) %>%\n  relocate(Year:ResultValue, .before = SiteType) %>%\n  mutate(\"SampleDate\" = case_when(\n    Year == 2014 ~ ymd(\"2014-08-06\"),\n    Year == 2015 ~ ymd(\"2015-09-10\"),\n    Year == 2018 ~ ymd(\"2018-09-20\"),\n    Year == 2019 ~ ymd(\"2019-09-12\"),\n    Year == 2020 ~ ymd(\"2020-09-17\"),\n    Year == 2021 ~ ymd(paste(`Date2021`))), \n    .after = `Year`) %>%\n  mutate(\"ResultUnit\" = case_when(\n    Parameter == \"TN\" ~ \"mg-N/L\",\n    Parameter == \"TP\" ~ \"\\U03BCg-P/L\" ,\n    Parameter == \"Cl\" ~ \"mg-Cl/L\"),\n    .after = `ResultValue`) %>%\n  select(-`Date2021`)\n  \n  splza_tidy\n\n```\n\nWhile reading in the original data, I named the columns to make pivoting them later on more easy by using a \"Year-Parameter\" pattern for each. I recoded the results that were below the detection limit of the testing method. The standard practice is to use half of the detection limit (or twice, if it was above the limit) in calculations. With the non-numeric data now replace, I converted the columns so that all the results were stored as numeric values. I used `pivot_longer()` to establish each individual case of a single sample result. I created a \"Date\" column and either pulled the 2021 date value from the original data or manually added the rest of the dates. Finally, I added Now my data was much tidier! I used this version of the data for some practice visualizations in my Homework 3.\n\n## Streamflow and Loading\n\nThe second data set needed is the estimated daily streamflow, measured in cubic feet per second (cfs). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has gages that collect continuous streamflow information at many locations throughout the watershed. A few of the Samplepalooza sites are co-located with gaging stations, some are on the same river as a gaging station but not at the same location, and many are on ungaged streams. I can estimate the streamflow at most locations by taking the streamflow (cfs) from 1 or 2 gaging stations either on the same river or nearby, dividing by the drainage area (sq mi) to the gage (cfs /sq mi), and then multiplying by the drainage area for the sampling location (back to cfs). While there are certainly more complicated methods of modeling streamflow that would take into account precipitation, land use, elevation, etc. into account, this is sufficient for what is already a fairly low resolution sampling project. \n\nTo make things more complicated, there are a couple sites that also have flow information from US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) flood control dams. New England's USACOE flood control dams usually only hold back water during significant rainfall or snowmelt to prevent flooding downstream, then slowly release it in the days after. This means that the flows may be significantly different from nearby streams without these dams. While one such site also has a USGS gage downstream of the dam, one only has the USACOE data, so I also needed to be able to incorporate this type of data into the calculations as well.\n\nI started with the code written by my volunteer, Travis (see Appendix for complete code). It consisted almost entirely of \"For\" loops and I didn't understand it at all, so Dr. Rolfe graciously re-interpreted it into the tidyr format. I then went back over the code, from beginning to end, and tweaked it to get everything working properly. I'll go through each step to show the process for gathering the streamflow data and calculating the loading and yield.\n\n### Step 1 - USGS Gage and USACOE IDs\n```{R}\n#| label: loading calculations - step 1\n#| tbl-cap: Samplepalooza Results Joined with USGS and ACOE Gage IDs\n\n# Comments starting with ### are from volunteer, ## are from MR helping convert the original code to tidyr, # are from Ryan\n\n### Disables scientific notation\noptions(scipen=999)\n\n### Bring in data on sampling locations (drainage area and USGS gages to use for flow estimation)\n# Add leading zero for USGS gages\n\nsplza_gages_orig <- read_xlsx(\"_data/Samplepalooza_gages.xlsx\") %>%\n  mutate(Gage1 = ifelse(is.na(Gage1), NA_character_, \n                        str_c(\"0\", Gage1, sep=\"\")),\n         Gage2 = ifelse(is.na(Gage2), NA_character_, \n                        str_c(\"0\", Gage2, sep=\"\"))) %>%\n  select(-c(\"Name\",\"Notes\",\"Lat\",\"Lon\"))\n\n# Attach Gage and Dam IDs to Results\nsplza_results_gages <- left_join(\n  splza_tidy,\n  splza_gages_orig,\n  by = \"SiteID\")\n\nresults_gages_display <- splza_results_gages %>%\n  select(-c(\"Year\", \"SiteType\", \"State\", \"EcoRegion\", \"Lat\", \"Lon\", \"OtherFlowSource\"))\n\nresults_gages_display\n```\n\nFirst, I needed to read in a second Excel sheet that contained the sample locations, drainage areas, and 1-2 USGS gage IDs and/or a USACOE dam ID. Then I joined it to the results by the site ID.\n\n### Step 2 - Pull USGS Gage Flows and Drainage Areas\n\n```{R}\n#| label: loading calculations - step 2\n#| tbl-cap: USGS Gage Data\n\n# Create list of gages and sample dates to pull from USGS database\n# readNWISdv is slow so reducing the number of queries as much as possible speeds up the following steps\n\nsplza_gages_dates <- splza_results_gages %>%\n  select(c(\"SampleDate\",\"Gage1\",\"Gage2\")) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Gage1\",\"Gage2\"),\n    names_to = NULL,\n    values_to = \"GageID\") %>%\n  drop_na(\"GageID\") %>%\n  distinct()\n\n# map streamflows from USGS for each date/gage combo\n# thanks to MR for simplifying this for me!\n\ngage_flows_by_date <-  purrr::map2_dfr(splza_gages_dates$GageID, splza_gages_dates$SampleDate,\n                     ~readNWISdv(siteNumbers=.x, \n                                 parameterCd = \"00060\",\n                                 startDate = .y,\n                                 endDate = .y)) %>%\n  rename(\"GageID\" = \"site_no\",\n         \"daily_cfs\" = \"X_00060_00003\") %>%\n  select(c(\"GageID\", \"Date\", \"daily_cfs\")) %>%\n  tibble()\n\n# USGS gage drainage areas\n\ngages_only <- splza_gages_dates %>%\n  select(\"GageID\") %>%\n  unique()\n\ngage_drainage <- purrr::map_dfr(gages_only$GageID,\n             ~readNWISsite(siteNumbers = .x)) %>%\n  rename(\"GageID\" = \"site_no\",\n         \"gage_drainage\" = \"drain_area_va\") %>%\n  select(c(\"GageID\", \"gage_drainage\")) %>%\n  tibble()\n\n# calculate cfsm (cubic feet per second per square mile)\n\ngages_cfsm <- left_join(\n  gage_flows_by_date,\n  gage_drainage,\n  by = \"GageID\") %>%\n  mutate(\"gage_daily_cfsm\" = daily_cfs/gage_drainage) %>%\n  select(-c(\"daily_cfs\", \"gage_drainage\"))\n\ngages_cfsm\n```\n\nUSGS offers an R package called `dataRetrieval`, which allows you to access their hydrologic and water quality data directly through R. To reduce the numbers of queries to their database, I created a list of unique gage and date combinations from the Samplepalooza data. I used `Purr` to map the `readNWISdv()` function which retrieves the daily streamflow data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) from a specific data and gage. I further refined the list to unique gage numbers and used `readNWISsite()`, which pulls all the available information on a gage and pulled out the drainage area for each gage. Finally, using this combination of data, I calculated the daily streamflow per square mile (cfsm) for each gage and date combination.\n\n### Step 3 - Pull USACOE Dam Flows\n\n```{R}\n#| label: loading calculations - step 3\n#| tbl-cap: USACOE Dam Data\n\n# USACoE Dam Flow Data\n# Thanks to MR for initially taming this beast\n\n# Dates and Dam codes for inquiry\n\nsplza_dams_dates <- splza_results_gages %>%\nselect(c(\"SampleDate\",\"USACOE_dam_id\", \"USACOE_dam_drainage\")) %>%\n  drop_na(\"USACOE_dam_id\") %>%\n  distinct()  \n\n### In some instances, two USGS gages were used and the values for each gage were averaged. When USACOE dams were used, the R script downloads the hourly inflow and outflow values, averages them to make a daily mean inflow and daily mean outflow, and then proceeds as if they were stream gage discharges.\n\n# function to read hourly dam outflow information and calculate average daily cfs\n\ndam_daily_cfs <-function(date, dam_id){  \n  url <- paste0(\"https://reservoircontrol.usace.army.mil/nae_ords/cwmsweb/cwms_web.apitable.table_display?gagecode=\",dam_id,\"&days=1&enddate=\",format.Date(date,\"%Y-%m-%d\"),\"&interval_hrs=1\")\n  dam_html <- read_html(url)\n  dam_tables <- html_nodes(dam_html,\"table\")\n  dam_info_list <- html_table(dam_tables[2], fill = TRUE, header = TRUE, trim = TRUE)\n  dam_flow_tibble <- dam_info_list[[1]]\n  dam_daily_flow <- summarize(dam_flow_tibble, \n                              \"dam_daily_cfs\" = mean(parse_number(dam_flow_tibble$`Flow(cfs)`))) %>%\n    mutate(\"SampleDate\" = rep(date),\n           \"USACOE_dam_id\" = rep(dam_id))\n  \n  return(dam_daily_flow)\n}\n\n# calculate daily cfs\n\ndam_cfs <- purrr::map2_dfr(splza_dams_dates$SampleDate, splza_dams_dates$USACOE_dam_id,\n                          ~dam_daily_cfs(date = .x,\n                                        dam_id = .y))\n\n# calculate  dams daily cfsm\n\ndams_cfsm <- left_join(\n  splza_dams_dates,\n  dam_cfs,\n  by= c(\"USACOE_dam_id\", \"SampleDate\")) %>%\n  mutate(\"dam_cfsm\" = dam_daily_cfs/USACOE_dam_drainage) %>%\n  select(-c(\"USACOE_dam_drainage\", \"dam_daily_cfs\"))\n\ndams_cfsm\n```\n\nNext, I needed to do the same thing for the two sites with USACOE dam information. Unfortunately, there wasn't an R package that interfaces easily with their data. They do post their flows online and there is a tidyverse package called `rvest` that can be used to \"harvest\" data from a website. Dr. Rolfe suggested writing a function to pull the web info and then using `Purrr` to map the dam IDs and dates to the function. The original code pulled the hourly data and then created a daily average from those numbers, so I did that as well. The drainage to the dam could also be pulled from the web using the same procedure, but in this case, the dam drainage areas were already in the spreadsheet with gage information. I was then able to follow the same calculation as above to calculate the daily cfsm for these dam ID and date combinations.\n\n### Step 4 - Estimate Flows, Loading and Yield\n```{R}\n#| label: loading calculations - step 4\n#| tbl-cap: Full Samplepalooza Results with Estimated Flow, Loading, and Yield Calculations\n\n# bind flows to results and estimate flows at site\n\nsplza_est_flows <- left_join(\n  splza_results_gages,\n  gages_cfsm,\n  by = c(\"SampleDate\" = \"Date\", \"Gage1\" = \"GageID\")) %>%\n  \n  rename(\"Gage1_cfsm\" = gage_daily_cfsm) %>%\n  \n  left_join(\n    .,\n    gages_cfsm,\n    by = c(\"SampleDate\" = \"Date\", \"Gage2\" = \"GageID\")) %>%\n  \n  rename(\"Gage2_cfsm\" = gage_daily_cfsm) %>%\n  \n  left_join(\n    .,\n    dams_cfsm,\n    by = c(\"SampleDate\", \"USACOE_dam_id\")) %>%\n  # Multiply cfsm by drainage\n  # 25-CNT has a special  calculation due to its location\n  # See notes on gages for reasoning\n  group_by(SiteID, SampleDate) %>%\n    mutate(\"Est_cfs\" = case_when(\n       SiteID == \"25-CNT\" ~ (Gage1_cfsm * (Drainage_sq_mi - 221) + (Gage2_cfsm * 221)),\n       SiteID != \"25-CNT\" ~ (mean(c(Gage1_cfsm, Gage2_cfsm, dam_cfsm), na.rm = TRUE)) * Drainage_sq_mi)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  select(-c(Gage1:dam_cfsm))\n  \n### Calculate loading\n### Note: 5.393771 and 0.005394 are calculated conversion factors to result in pounds/day\n\n### mg_L_conversion_factor = mg/L * ft3/second * 28.3168 L/1 ft3 * 1 lb/453592 mg * 86400 second/1 day\n### ug_L_conversion_factor = mg/L * ft3/second * 28.3168 L/1 ft3 * 1 lb/453592370 ug * 86400 second/1 day\n\nmg_L_conversion_factor <- 5.393771\nug_L_conversion_factor <- 0.005394\n\nsplza_results_loading <- splza_est_flows %>%\n  mutate(\n    \"Est_loading\" = case_when(\n    str_detect(ResultUnit, \"mg\") ~ (Est_cfs * ResultValue * mg_L_conversion_factor),\n    str_detect(ResultUnit, \"\\u03bcg\") ~ (Est_cfs * ResultValue * ug_L_conversion_factor)),\n    \"Est_yield\" = (Est_loading / Drainage_sq_mi)\n  )\n\nsplza_results_loading\n```\n\nFinally, I joined the cfsm values to the results and estimated the flows at each site. For all except one site, this is done by multiplying the average of the cfsm values available by the drainage area to the sites. There is one site with a slightly different method due to its proximity to various gages and dams. I then multiplied the estimated flows by the concentrations from the sample results and a conversion factor that puts the loading values into pounds per day. Then I did one last calculation by dividing the loading by the site drainage area to get the yield in pounds per day per square mile.\n\n# Visualization\n```{R}\n#| label: visualization set up\n\n# EPA EcoRegion Thresholds\n\necVIII_tn <- 0.38\necXIV_tn <- 0.71\necVIII_tp <- 10\necXIV_tp <- 31.25\n\n# add in columns about meeting threshold\n\nsplza_thresholds <- splza_results_loading %>%\n  mutate(\"Criteria\" = case_when(\n    Parameter == \"TN\" & EcoRegion == \"VIII\" ~ ecVIII_tn,\n    Parameter == \"TN\" & EcoRegion == \"XIV\"  ~ ecXIV_tn,\n    Parameter == \"TP\" & EcoRegion == \"VIII\" ~ ecVIII_tp,\n    Parameter == \"TP\" & EcoRegion == \"XIV\"  ~ ecXIV_tp),\n    \"Exceeds_criteria\" = case_when(\n      ResultValue > Criteria ~ \"Exceeds\",\n      ResultValue <=Criteria ~ \"Meets\")\n  )\n\n# remove outliers\n# beause the data for each site is so limited, there's not a mathematical way to remove outliers (see homework 3)\n# I removed excessive results manually for now\n# see the conclusion for more info\n\nsplza_results_loading_no_outliers <- splza_thresholds %>%\n  filter((Parameter == \"TP\" & ResultValue < 150) | (Parameter == \"Cl\" & ResultValue < 100) | Parameter == \"TN\")\n\n# filter into mainstem and tributary datasets\nmainstem <- splza_results_loading_no_outliers %>%\n  filter(SiteType == \"Mainstem\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(Lat))\n\ntributary <- splza_results_loading_no_outliers %>%\n  filter(SiteType == \"Tributary\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(Lat))\n\n# create custom labels\n\nparameter_labs <- c(Cl = \"Chloride\\n(mg-Cl/L)\", TN = \"Total Nitrogen\\n(mg-N/L)\", TP = \"Total Phosphorus\\n(\\U03BCg-P/L)\")\nloading_labs <- c(Cl = \"Chloride\", TN = \"Total Nitrogen\", TP = \"Total Phosphorus\")\n```\nFor this project, I wanted to practice recreating some of the visualizations that I have been making for years in Excel and GIS as well as create something new. I broke this section down into two parts: Graphs and Maps. \n\n## Graphs\n\nRaw water quality data is difficult for people to understand without visualizations that guide them towards understanding whether the result is good or bad. \n\n### Recreating Old Graphs\n\nFor all of these graphs, I made sure that the sites were listed from North to South. This is useful because as the Connecticut River flows from north to south, the river acquires more water (and pollutants) and starts to flow from mountains which have naturally low nutrients to valley floors which naturally have higher nutrients. \n```{R}\n#| label: visualization charts - mainstem concentrations\n#| fig-cap: Samplepalooza Mainstem Results\n\nggplot(mainstem, aes(y = fct_reorder(SiteName, Lat), x = ResultValue, fill = Year)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(x = \"Results\", y = \"Site Location\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Parameter), scales = \"free_x\", labeller = labeller(Parameter = parameter_labs))\n```\nThis is a look at all of the results from the mainstem sites over the years. As you can see, Connecticut was added later in the project life. In general, the concentrations increase from north to south, though they seem to peak at Middletown. Essex is brackish, so the chloride is omitted for that location since the water is naturally salty.\n\n```{R fig.height = 12}\n#| label: visualization charts - tributary concentrations\n#| fig-cap: Samplepalooza Tributary Results\n\nggplot(tributary, aes(y = fct_reorder(SiteName, Lat), x = ResultValue, fill = Year)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(x = \"Results\", y = \"Site Location\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Parameter), \n             rows = vars(EcoRegion), \n             scales = \"free\", \n             labeller = labeller(Parameter = parameter_labs, EcoRegion = label_both))\n```\nThese are the results from all the tributaries, split up by EcoRegion and parameter. We expect to see higher nutrients in EcoRegion XIV than in VIII, which is demonstrated here. The tributaries are arranged from north to south again, but each tributary is affected also by how much urbanization and agriculture is within it, rather than its north-south orientation.\n\n\n```{R fig.height = 12, fig.width = 10}\n#| label: loading ranked by watershed size\n#| fig-cap: Loading by Watershed Size\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nggplot(tributary, aes(x = Est_loading, y = fct_reorder(SiteName, Drainage_sq_mi), fill = State)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"black\", stat = \"summary\", fun = \"median\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(x = \"Median Loading (lbs/day)\", y = \"Site Locations\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  facet_grid(\n    cols = vars(Parameter), \n    rows = vars(EcoRegion), \n    scales = \"free\", \n    labeller = labeller(Parameter = loading_labs, EcoRegion = label_both))\n```\nThis graph has been very popular when I presented the results in 2019. I was easily able to also split it by EcoRegion using `facet_grid()`. If each tributary was contributing its \"fair share\" of chloride, nitrogen, and phosphorus, they would also (more or less) go from largest loading to smallest in each EcoRegion; we would also expect EcoRegion XIV. Some noteable over contributers are the Farmington, Millers, Scantic, and Fort Rivers. \n\n### New Data Exploration\n\n```{R fig.asp = 0.4}\n#| label: Concentration v loading\n#| fig-cap: Concentration versus Loading in Samplepalooza Tributaries\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nggplot(tributary, aes(y = Est_loading, x = ResultValue, color = State)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(x = \"Concentration\", y = \"Loading (lbs/day\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Parameter), \n             scales = \"free\",\n             labeller = labeller(Parameter = loading_labs))\n\n```\nThis graph shows the concentration versus the loading of each tributary sample. It is interesting that most of the sites contributing the highest loading of each parameter do not have the highest concentration, especially with chloride. If we wanted to direct restoration efforts on particular tributaries, those efforts should be targeted to watersheds that fall in the upper right quandrant of these graphs to have the biggest impact.\n\n```{R}\n#| label: concentration violin plots\n#| fig-cap: Distribution of Tributary Concentrations\n\nggplot(tributary, aes(x = State, y = ResultValue, fill = Parameter)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2), fill = \"none\") +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(Parameter), \n             cols = vars(EcoRegion), \n             scales = \"free\",\n             labeller = labeller(EcoRegion = label_both, Parameter = parameter_labs))\n```\nI was particularly interested in the utility of the violin plots. I have been criticized in the past by other professionals in my field for my reluctance to use box and whisker plots. Aside from the fact that they are nearly impossible to make in Excel, I have conducted some informal polls and found that non-scientists *do not* understand the information a box and whisker plot is trying to convey. These violin plots seem to present the distribution a little more intuitively. In this graph, we can see that Vermont and New Hampshire have bottom heavy plots (which is what we would like to see) and Connecticut and Massachusetts have more even distribution across the ranges of concentrations.\n\n```{R}\n#| label: Violin Plots comparing loading\n#| fig-cap: Distribution of  Loading\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nggplot(tributary, aes(x = State, y = Est_loading, fill = Parameter)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n   scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(y = \"Estimated Loading (lbs/day)\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n   facet_grid(rows = vars(Parameter), \n              scales = \"free\",\n              labeller = labeller(Parameter = loading_labs))\n```\nThis is the same graph but looking at loading. Here, we can see that all the plots are bottom heavy with Connecticut and Massachusetts having the heavier hitting tributaries compared to New Hampshire and Vermont. \n\n## Maps\n```{R}\n#| label: maps set up\n#| output: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n\n# Watershed States\nwatershed_states <- map_data(\"state\") %>% \n  filter(region %in% c(\"connecticut\", \"massachusetts\", \"vermont\", \"new hampshire\")) %>% \n           filter(!subregion %in% c(\"martha's vineyard\", \"nantucket\"))\n# map files\ntrib_map <- st_read(\"_data/maps/Splza_tribs.shp\") %>%\n  fortify() %>%\n  mutate(SiteID = str_trim(SiteID))\n\nmainstem_map <- st_read(\"_data/maps/Splza_main.shp\") %>%\n  fortify() %>%\n  mutate(SiteID = str_trim(SiteID))\n\n# join with data \ntrib_map_data <- splza_results_loading_no_outliers %>%\n   filter(SiteType == \"Tributary\") %>%\n  full_join(.,\n  trib_map,\n  by = c(\"SiteID\" = \"SiteID\")) %>% #not sure why it made me do this, but just putting SiteID didn't work\n    st_as_sf()\n\nmain_map_data <- splza_results_loading_no_outliers %>%\n   filter(SiteType == \"Mainstem\") %>%\n  full_join(.,\n  mainstem_map,\n  by = c(\"SiteID\" = \"SiteID\")) %>%\n    st_as_sf()\n```\nMaking maps is also very important for presenting water quality data in a way that makes sense to the average viewer. I primarily present my work to the volunteers who collect the data, at public meetings, or to school children. The easier to understand, the better!\n\nTo set up these maps, I created a base of the four watershed states using the `maps` package, which I first did in Homework 3. I used the USGS StreamStats program and GIS to make a shapefile of all the tributaries and the mainstem sites that would be easy to join with the data in R. This map layer already existed prior to this project. I read this file in using the `sf` package and joined it with the data. Then the shapes were ready to be plotted in `ggplot2`. \n\n```{R}\n#| label: tn map 1\n#| fig-cap: Tributary Nitrogen Concentrations by Year\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nfilter(trib_map_data, Parameter == \"TN\") %>%\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = watershed_states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = region), color = \"dark green\", linetype = \"dotted\", fill=\"green\", alpha=0.3) +\n  expand_limits(x = watershed_states$long, y = watershed_states$lat) +\n  scale_shape_identity() +\n  coord_map() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = ResultValue, color = Exceeds_criteria)) +\nscale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Blues\", direction = 1, breaks = c(0, 0.4, 0.7, 1.5, 3), name = \"Total Nitrogen\\n(mg-N/L)\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"EcoRegion Criteria\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Year))\n```\nUsing `ggplot2` and `facet_wrap()` to create these maps is very useful. I used to have to make a different layer for each year in GIS and export it separately to put in my reports.\n\nIn this figure, you can see the relative concentrations and the outline indicates whether or not the watershed meets the criteria for its EcoRegion. It is particularly stark that only the Scantic River watershed is the darkest blue.\n\n```{R}\n#| label: tp map 1\n#| fig-cap: Mainstem Phosphorus Concentrations by Year\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nfilter(main_map_data, Parameter == \"TP\") %>%\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = watershed_states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = region), color = \"dark green\", linetype = \"dotted\", fill=\"green\", alpha=0.3) +\n  expand_limits(x = watershed_states$long, y = watershed_states$lat) +\n  scale_shape_identity() +\n  coord_map() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = ResultValue, color = Exceeds_criteria)) +\nscale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Reds\", direction = 1, breaks = c(0, 10, 31, 60, 125), name = \"Total Phosphorus\\n(\\u03bc/L)\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"EcoRegion Criteria\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Year))\n\n```\nThis is an example of a similar map with the mainstem sites instead of the tributaries.\n\n```{R}\n#| label: loading maps\n#| fig-cap: Tributary Chloride Yields\n#| warning: FALSE\n\nfilter(trib_map_data, Parameter == \"Cl\") %>%\n  group_by(SiteName) %>%\n  mutate(\"avg_yield\" = mean(Est_yield)) %>%\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = watershed_states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = region), color = \"dark green\", linetype = \"dotted\", fill=\"green\", alpha=0.3) +\n  expand_limits(x = watershed_states$long, y = watershed_states$lat) +\n  scale_shape_identity() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = avg_yield)) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Purples\", direction = 1, name = \"Chloride\\nAverage Yield\\n(lbs/day/sq mi)\") +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\nFinally, I made an example of the yields. The yields are the loading (lbs/day) adjusted for the area of the watershed. This helps adjust the concentrations to the impact of the watershed. Since the sizes of the watersheds are represented in the image, the yield is useful for mapping loading.\n\n# Reflection\n\nI chose to focus my project on practicing the visualizations I would need to create an effective report for work. I am expecting to be writing a report and following it up with an online presentation to all the partners who have participated in Samplepalooza over the years this winter. One of the challenges of the project has been communicating the results at a level acceptable to the state agencies that participate but presenting it in a way that is also understandable to the volunteers who collected samples. I think the ease with which I can now create maps (especially faceted by year) will make that task a lot easier. \n\nRebuilding the code to estimate the loading was the most difficult part of this project, but I learned a lot from it. I feel confident that I could build similar functions from scratch moving forward.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRather than answering the specific question of what tributary is the biggest contributor of nitrogen or phosphorus, the research question is \"Can I learn to use R to streamline how I work with my water quality data at work?\" The answer is a resounding \"Yes\"! \n\nThere are lots of other water quality data that I work with constantly that are slightly different from the data I was working with here. The original loading calculation program that I was working with was highly specialized for Samplepalooza. By utilizing the principals of tidy data and using the new function with `purrr`, I am confident that I could use this same code to estimate loading for any water quality monitoring site that I work with. \n\nAs I was working on this project, I also identified the next few things I will do after the conclusion of this class. I will need to write a function to replace the data censored with a \"<\" or \">\" with the appropriate value for statistical calculation. I will also need to write a function that can use the USGS gage data to classify flows as low, moderate, or high; this is based on the quartile that the flows fall in. Ideally, when presenting water quality data, only results from like flows should be compared. For example, the water quality conditions on a hot, dry summer day are expected to be significantly different than those during the spring snowmelt.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nDam Release Information.
