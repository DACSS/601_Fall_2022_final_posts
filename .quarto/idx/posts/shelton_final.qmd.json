All 67 Florida counties have data for the 3 years, resulting in 201 observations of 15 variables. Each observation provides a count (or rate) for all variables from a single county for a year. The variables selected closely mirror the stressors mentioned in the reference study (Zugazaga), along with supplementary variables in an attempt to completely capture the circumstances.\n\nHomelessness is a complex living situation with several qualifying conditions; at its simplest state, the U.S Dept. of Housing and Urban Development defines it as **lacking a fixed, regular nighttime residence (not a shelter) or having a nighttime residence not designed for human accommodation**^1^.\n\nOn a single night in 2020, over 500,000^2^ people experienced homelessness in the United States. Florida - the third largest state by population - had the fourth largest homeless population of 2020 with 27,487^2^.\n\nFlorida counties represent a wide range of demographic profiles; the state is a hub to a variety of industries including tourism, defense, agriculture, and information technology. Investigating homelessness in Florida counties with robust data can lead to several conclusions about *who* is being impacted *where*, and how state policy is failing (or aiding) groups of a diverse population.\n\n## Introduction\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Research Question\n\nCarole Zugazaga's 2004 study of 54 single homeless men, 54 single homeless women, and 54 homeless women with children in the Central Florida area investigated stressful life events common among homeless people. Interview responses revealed that women were more likely to have been sexually or physically assaulted, while men were more likely to have been incarcerated or abuse drugs/alcohol. Homeless women with children were more likely to be in foster care as a youth.\n\nNearly a decade later, county-level data can be used to investigate the relationship between Zugazaga's reported stressful life events (incarceration, drug arrests, poverty, forcible sex, foster care)^3^ and homelessness rates.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Research Question\n\nDo particular life stressors increase a population's vulnerability to homelessness?\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nHomelessness is not a new issue in the United States, yet homeless policy targets elimination via criminalization rather than prevention. A 2019 article from [Homeless Voice](https://homelessvoice.org/the-policies-and-laws-of-florida-cities/) provides a brief description of homeless policy in major citites across Florida. Despite state and federal governments being aware of the circumstances that increase vulnerability to homelessness for decades, I anticipate at least one Zugazaga's five stressors to remain significant in a model relating stressors to Florida homelessness counts 2018-2020.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Research Hypothesis\n\n**H~0~:** All stressors are insignificant in predicting homelessness counts **(** B~i~ = 0 for i=0,1,2,...n **)**\n\n**H~A~:** At least one stressor **B~i~** is significant in predicting homelessness counts\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| label: loading florida_1820\n#| include: false\n\n# This data was cleaned and formatted to a tidy .csv in another .qmd file, the manipulations were messy and probably inefficient (brute force); can upload if needed\n\nflorida_og <- readr::read_csv('_data/florida_1820.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)%>%\n                      rename('Adult Psych Beds (Count)' = 'Adult Pysch Beds (Count)')\n\n```\n\n## Data Read-in and Tidying\n\nThe data were collected from the [Florida Department of Health](https://www.flhealthcharts.gov/charts/default.aspx). Variable names^3^ were used as search indicators to produce counts for Florida counties. Unfortunately, we cannot accurately analyze the effect of COVID-19 as data is incomplete for the majority of counties in 2021.\n\nRead in and tidying were done in a separate file. The process began as laborious, but was lightened by the discovery of 10 year tables. Before this discovery, I would enter a variable name into the search bar of [Florida Department of Health](https://www.flhealthcharts.gov/charts/default.aspx), select 2018, and download the .xlsx file to my personal data folder. `readxl` was used to bring in the file, and `mutate` created a date column filled with 2018. Once the data was appropriate, I saved it in the environment under `variable2018`. This was repeated for years 2019 and 2020. Then all three tibbles were `full _join` by `County` to provide a dataset with 201 observations (67 counties by 3 years) and three variables, `County`, `Year`, and the variable measurement itself . This was written as a .csv back to the same personal data folder.\n\n![](images/screenshot2-01.png)\n\nOnce learning that I could draw 10-year tables from the website rather than having to download three individual .xlsx files, the process became smoother. Now, I would only rename excess years as \"delete\" to get a table of measurements for only 2018, 2019, and 2020. `pivot_longer` then moved the years to a self-titled column and transferred the values to a column of my naming. This was written as a .csv.\n\n![](images/screenshot3.png)\n\nI then merged all the tables and wrote this as a .csv `florida_full`. I completed a sanity check using distinct county names to ensure I had 201 observations of 15 variables as desired.\n\n![](images/screenshot5.png)\n\n![](images/screenshot6-01.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Intro to Data **Tables**\n\n```{r}\n#| label: EDA\n#| output: TRUE\n\nhead(florida_og)\n\nsummary(florida_og)\n\n# Changing Counts to Rates and Excluding Population \n#Surely there's a better way to do this!\n\nflorida_og_rates <- florida_og %>%\n                      mutate('Homeless (Rate)' = `Homeless (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Poverty (Rate)' = `Poverty (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Drug Arrests (Rate)' = `Drug Arrests (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Sub Abuse Enrollment (Rate)' = \n                               `Sub Abuse Enrollment (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Adult Psych Beds (Rate)' = \n                               `Adult Psych Beds (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Forcible Sex (Rate)' =  `Forcible Sex (Count)`/`Population`,\n                             'Foster Care (Rate)' =  `Foster Care (Count)`/`Population`)\n\n\n                      \n                              \nflorida_county <- florida_og %>%\n                      group_by(County)\n                        \nflorida_county %>% \n  summarize('Mean Population' = mean(Population), \n            'Mean Homeless' = mean(`Homeless (Count)`),\n            'Avg Homeless Rate' = mean(`Homeless (Count)`)/mean(Population),\n            'Avg Median Income'= mean(`Median Inc`), \n            'Mean Poverty' = mean(`Poverty (Count)`), \n            'Avg Poverty Rate' = mean(`Poverty (Count)`)/mean(Population),\n            'Avg Incarceration Rate (per 1000)' = mean(`Incarceration (Rateper1000)`))%>%\n                arrange( desc(`Mean Population`), desc(`Mean Homeless`), \n                         desc(`Avg Median Income`))%>%\n                                  mutate(across(c(2:3, 5:6), round, 0))\n                \n  \n\n```\n:::\n\nExpanding **Intro to Data** exposes summary statistics including mean, range, quantiles, and standard deviation for all 15 variables.

The state is generally uniform, with the bulk of each region's distribution sitting below 0.25% of county populations.\n\n    -   The largest difference is between the distributions of Northwest Florida and South Florida. This can be attributed to the stark contrast in where the population in these regions are living.\n\n    -   South Florida is the most urbanized region in the state, with millions living in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach; Northwest Florida is quite the opposite, with small coastal towns and rural inland towns reminiscent of Southern Alabama or Georgia.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## c) Homeless Rate by Income Level\n\n```{r}\n#| label: plot3 - homeless x income\n#| echo: true\n#| collapse: true\n#| output: true\n\n\n# Plot 3\n#Relevel Income, Mutate Response \nflorida_income <- florida_og_plot %>%\n    mutate(`Homeless (Rate)` = `Homeless (Rate)`*100)%>%\n      mutate(`Income Level` = fct_relevel(`Income Level`, \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))%>%\n      ggplot(aes(y=`Homeless (Rate)`, x=`Region`,\n                  fill=`Income Level`, \n                    )) +\n      geom_bar(position='dodge', stat='identity')+\n          \n              scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set2')+\n                                   theme_grey()+\n                                     \n                    labs(title= \"Barplot: Income Level x Homeless Rate\", \n                           subtitle=\"2018-2020\", \n                              x= \"Region\", \n                                y= \"Homeless Rate (%)\", \n                                  caption = \"Visualized by Income Level\")\n\nflorida_income\n\n```\n\n-   The barplot further details the differences mentioned in `Plot 2`.

Stressors influence homelessness by driving those in severe situations *out* of their home or *away* from their place of origin. `Homeless (Rate)` is not an ideal measure of magnitude as the homeless population migrating to escape or avoid certain stressors would result in counties with low stressor values having a higher homeless population; this effect is left unexplained by the following models.\n\n-   The variable `Relocated (Rate)` is included as an attempt to control for new movement, however this doesn't completely capture county-to-county migration.\n\n-   FL Charts has data that records [Population Who Lived in a Different County One Year Earlier](https://www.flhealthcharts.gov/ChartsDashboards/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=NonVitalIndRateOnly.TenYrsRpt&cid=9759), however with the data spanning 2009-2014, using values recorded 4 years prior to our data isn't desirable either.\n\n-   The most appropriate data to accurately capture county-to-county migration is [here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/demo/geographic-mobility/county-to-county-migration-2015-2019.html) via the US Census Bureau. The `-In, -Out, -Net...` spreadsheet provides totals for each county in the United States and movement to all other US counties; unfortunately, this data is too complex to wrangle into the simple data set `florida_1820.csv`.\n\n### on Assumption of Linearity\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fit1 scatter\n#| output: true\n#| echo: true\n\n# Fit 1: A Linear Regression Model With All Vars\n\n# Checking Linearity of variables not supported by our literature\n# Correlation Matrix\nflorida_matrix <- florida_og_rates %>%\n                    select(-c(contains(\"Count\"), \n                              'Year', \n                              'Poverty (Rate)', \n                              'Severe Housing Problems (Rate)',\n                              'Incarceration (Rateper1000)',\n                              'Sub Abuse Enrollment (Rate)',\n                              'Drug Arrests (Rate)',\n                              'Adult Psych Beds (Rate)',\n                              'Foster Care (Rate)',\n                              'Forcible Sex (Rate)' ))%>%\n                      pairs()\nflorida_matrix\n```\n\nA quick look at stressors with a relationship to homelessness not mentioned in Zugazaga's study, or those that needed further investigation are shown here to confirm linearity with the response, `Homeless (Rate)`.

To do this, deeper demographic variables would need to be included, as well as improvements in controlling for stressors as a *push* factor in homeless migration.\n\n    -   We would also need to incorporate variables that aren't strictly associated with homelessness (loss of a loved one, severe bodily injury, chronic illness...) for an improved comparison.\n\n-   Because of limitations in the data, and the broad scope of the research question, the study isn't able to make any new comments on the status of homelessness in Florida, it instead confirms the relevance of Zugazaga's stressors to homeless life two decades later.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Prediction vs Inference\n\n-   The goal of this brief study was to make inferences regarding stressors' impact on `Homelessness (Rate)` in Florida.\n\n-   If prediction was our focus, I would use new 2021 data from FL Charts without the `Homeless (Rate)` column to test the efficacy of `Fit 2` as a predictive tool.\n:::\n\n## Improvements\n\nWhile the data is quick illustration of homelessness in Florida by county, there are improvements that could be made to both data collection and the research question itself to further the study.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Data\n\n-   Unfortunately, [FL Health Charts](https://www.flhealthcharts.gov/charts/default.aspx) did not provide demographic breakdown for the homeless population (Age, Sex, Race), which would drastically widen the scope of the analysis, leading to far more interesting conclusions.\n\n-   There is only have data for a three year period; this is too small of a range to make a strong statement about the impact of homeless policy on Florida counties or how the relevance of certain stressors has *changed* over time. For a more in depth study I would begin with a 10 year range.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Research Question\n\n-   Demographic breakdown of stressors' impact (Age, Sex, Race)\n\n-   Modernize Zugazaga's interviews to adjust variables for homelessness in 2022\n\n    -   conduct interviews with groups of single men, single women, and women with children\n\n-   Reduce noise; once controlling for county, hone in on 1 or 2 certain stressors and their accompanying variables to view their impact on a population instead of viewing a broad range of stressors as a whole\n\n-   Included life stressors not associated with homelessness for comparison\n\n-   Extend the question to the entire country, providing a breakdown by state\n\n-   Compare to foreign countries to contrast governments' approaches to homelessness and leading causes of homelessness around the world.\n:::\n:::\n\n## References\n\n**Chang, W.
