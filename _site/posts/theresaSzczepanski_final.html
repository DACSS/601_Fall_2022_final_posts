<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests were introduced as part of the Massachusetts Education Reform Act in 1993 with the goal of providing all students with the skills and knowledge to thrive in a “complex and changing society” (Papay et. al, 2020 pp, 1). The MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on the Grade 10 Math MCAS test “predict longer-term educational attainments and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student advantage. For example, among demographically similar students who attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores.” (Papay et. al, 2020 pp 7-10)</p>
<p>In this report, I will analyze the Spring 2022 MCAS Results for students completing the High School Introductory Physics MCAS at <a href="https://risingtide.org/">Rising Tide Charter Public School</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>MCAS_2022</code> data frame contains performance results from 495 students from Rising Tide on the Spring 2022 <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/default.html">Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)</a> tests.</p>
<p>For each student, there are values reported for 256 different variables which consist of information from four broad categories</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Demographic characteristics</em> of the students themselves (e.g., race, gender, date of birth, town, grade level, years in school, years in Massachusetts, and low income, title1, IEP, 504, and EL status ).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Key assessment features</em> including subject, test format, and accommodations provided</p></li>
<li><p><em>Performance metrics</em>: This includes a student’s score on individual item strands, e.g.,<code>sitem1</code>-<code>sitem42</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See the <code>MCAS_2022</code> data frame summary and <strong>codebook</strong> in the <strong>appendix</strong> for further details.</p>
<p>The second data set, <code>SG9_Item</code>, is <span class="math inline">\(42 \times 9\)</span> and consists of 9 variables with information pertaining to the 42 questions on the 2022 <a href="https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/mcas/mcasitems2.aspx?grade=HS&amp;subjectcode=PHY&amp;linkid=23&amp;orgcode=04830000&amp;fycode=2022&amp;orgtypecode=5&amp;">HS Introductory Physics Item Report</a>. The variables can be broken down into 2 categories:</p>
<p>Details about the content of a given test item:</p>
<p>This includes the content <code>Reporting Category</code> (MF (motion and forces) WA (waves), and EN (energy)), the <code>Standard</code> from the <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf">2016 STE Massachusetts Curriculum Framework</a>, the <code>Item Description</code> providing the details of what specifically was asked of students, and the points available for a given question, <code>item Possible Points</code>.</p>
<p>Summary Performance Metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For each item, the state reports the percentage of points earned by students at Rising Tide, <code>RT Percent Points</code>, the percentage of available points earned by students in the state, <code>State Percent Points</code>, and the difference between the percentage of points earned by Rising Tide students and the percentage of points earned by students in the state, <code>RT-State Diff</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, <code>SG9_CU306Dis</code> and <code>SG9_CU306NonDis</code> are <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 5\)</span> dataframes consisting of summary performance data by <code>Reporting Category</code> for students with disabilities and without disabilities; most importantly including <code>RT Percent Points</code> and <code>State Percent Points</code>by disability status.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When considering our student performance data, we hope to address the following broad questions:</p>
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class="blue">
<ul>
<li><p>What adjustments (if any) should be made at the Tier 1 level, i.e., curricular adjustments for all students in the General Education setting?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be the most beneficial areas of focus for a targeted intervention course for students struggling to meet or exceed performance expectations?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there notable differences in student performance for students with and without disabilities?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-library">Function Library</h2>
<p>To read in, tidy, and join our data frames for each content area we will use functions. In this library. I am also drafting some functions that I would use to scale up this project. There is still work to be done here.</p>

<p>After examining the summary of <code>MCAS_2022</code> (see appendix), I chose to</p>
<p><strong>Filter</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>SchoolID</em> : There are several variables that identify our school, I removed all but one, <code>testschoolcode</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>StudentPrivacy</em>: I left the <code>sasid</code> variable which is a student identifier number, but eliminated all values corresponding to students’ names.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dis</code>: We are a charter school within our own unique district, therefore any “district level” data is identical to our “school level” data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rename</strong></p>
<p>I currently have not renamed variables, but there are some trends to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <code>e</code> before most <code>ELA</code> MCAS student item performance metric variables</li>
<li>an <code>m</code> before most <code>Math</code> MCAS student item performance metric variables</li>
<li>an <code>s</code> before most <code>Science</code> MCAS student item performance metric variables</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mutate</strong></p>
<p>I left as <strong>doubles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>variables that measured scores on specific MCAS items e.g., <code>mitem1</code></li>
<li>variables that measured student growth percentiles (<code>sgp</code>)</li>
<li>variables that counted a student’s years in the school system or state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recode to <strong>char</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>variables that are <strong>nominal</strong> but have numeric values, e.g., <code>town</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Refactor as <strong>ord</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>variables that are <strong>ordinal</strong>, e.g., <code>mperflev</code>.</li>

<p>Recode to <strong>date</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>dob</code> using lubridate.</li>

<p>When I compared this data frame to the State reported analysis, the state analysis only contains 68 students. Notably, my data frame has 69 entries while the state is reporting data on only 68 students. I will have to investigate this further.</p>
<p>Since I will join this data frame with the <code>SG9_Item</code>, using <code>sitem</code> as the key, I need to pivot this data set longer.</p>

<p>Now, we should be ready to join our data sets using <code>sitem</code> as the key. We should have a 2,898 by (10 + 8) = 2,898 by 18 data frame.

<p>The proportion of points lost by Rising Tide students corresponds to the proportion of points available for each <code>Reporting Category</code> of the the exam. This suggests that our students are prepared consistently across the units in the <code>Reporting Categories</code>.</p>

<p>Here we see the distribution of <code>RT-State Diff</code> (difference between the percentage of points earned on a given item by Rising Tide students and percentage of points earned on the same item by their peers in the State) by <code>sitem</code> and content <code>Reporting Category</code>. We can see generally that items in the Motion and Forces <code>Reporting Category</code> seems to display the most concerning variability in student performance relative to the state. It would be worth looking at the specific question strands with the Physics Teachers. (It would be helpful to add item labels to the dots using <code>ggplotly</code>, however I did not find a way to have that render on the class blog)</p>

<p>When considering <code>RT-State Diff</code> against <code>State Percent Points</code> for each <code>sitem</code> on the MCAS, this does not seem to generally be the case. Although the regression line shows <code>RT-State Diff</code> more likely to be negative on items where students in the State earned fewer points, the p-value is not significant.</p>

<p>Is the “calculation gap” consistent across performance levels?</p>
</div>
<p>Here we can see that students with a higher performance level lost a greater proportion of their points on questions involving “Calculate”. I.e., the higher a student’s performance level, the greater the percentage of their points were lost to items asking them to “calculate”. This suggests that in the general classroom to raise student performance, students should spend a higher proportion of time on calculation based activities.</p>

<p>We can see from our <code>CU306</code> reports that our students with disabilities performed better relative to their peers in the state, <code>RT-State Diff</code>, across all <code>Reporting Categories</code>, while our non-disabled students performed worse relative to their peers in the state across all <code>Reporting Categories</code>.

<p>A student’s performance on their 9th Grade Introductory Physics MCAS is strongly associated with their performance on their 8th Grade Math MCAS exam. This suggests that the use of prior Math MCAS and current STAR Math testing data can identify students in need of extra support.</p>

<p>Rising Tide students as a whole performed slightly weaker relative to the state in all content reporting areas; however, students classified as disabled performed better relative to their peers in the state. The performance gap between Rising Tide students and students in the state on the HS Introductroy Physics exam is accounted for by the performance of the non-disabled students in the general classroom setting.</p>
<p>All Rising Tide students, regardless of disability status, performed significantly weaker relative to students in the State on items including the key word “Calculate” in their <code>item description</code>. This suggests that we should dedicate more classroom instructional time to problem solving with calculation. Notably, the higher a student’s performance level, the higher the percentage of points a student lost for calculation items. The largest area of growth for students across all performance categories is on calculation based items; evidence based math interventions include small group, differentiated problem sets.</p>
<p>The discrepancy in performance by Rising Tide students with and without disabilities relative to their associated academic peers in the state, suggest that our non-disabled students would benefit from some of the practices and supports currently provided to our students on IEPs. Differentiated, tiered, small group problem sets in the general classroom setting could potentially address the “calculation gap”.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-limitationsareas-for-improvement">Reflection: Limitations/Areas for Improvement</h2>
<p>I was inspired to work on this report after years of experience working at a public school. Public education is a sector that is filled with passion and positive intentions but also divisive discussions. There exist a plethora of simplistic “one-trick fixes” that are marketed to students, teachers, and families. The use of data is the best tool we have against pressing forward and investing our precious time and money with initiatives that do not improve student outcomes.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve noticed that teachers and leaders are given annual data reports yet, most lack the time, capacity, or resources to identify evidence based, actionable measures to enact in the classroom or at the organizational level. When presented with all of the questions from an assessment individually and the performance of all of one’s students on paper, it is difficult to identify trends. Anecdotally, I have noticed every year the majority of teachers gravitating to the scores and performance of individual students that they previously taught and ascribing mistakes or successes to specific experiences with an individual or one word in a question prompt. While relationship building and teaching to a child are hallmarks to student-teacher relationships, a narrow lens like this will not allow a teacher to identify classroom level changes or curriculum level changes that could impact all students and future students. In one’s compassionate focus on individuals, a great opportunity to promote the learning for all students is lost.</p>
<p>With the use of R, and the MCAS reports, I decided to focus on ways to identify trends at the classroom or curricular level. I found it challenging to limit the scope of my work for this project. Also, I struggled with discerning when to use <code>sum</code> vs.&nbsp;when to use <code>averages</code> or <code>medians</code>. To improve a student’s performance on a test, we are concerned with total points lost and relative weight of a content category; to identify curricular weaknesses we are also interested in relative performance to the state by content area.</p>
<p>I only completed the analysis of the Introductory Physics Exam for High school students. I have <code>ELA</code>, <code>Math</code>, and <code>Science</code> results for grades 5-8 as well as grade 10. I am still working on building a general function library to generate similar graphics and tables for other content areas and grade levels and I would like to complete a similar report for each grade level and subject area assessment for teachers to use.</p>
<p>Given access to historical data, I think it would be beneficial to examine these trends over time to discern the performance gaps attributable to changes in the population of students (a factor which we cannot control or change) vs.&nbsp;those attributable to curriculum and teaching (an area we can influence and effect change).</p>
<p>I also have access to reports that include the teacher a student had and the grades they earned from their teacher in the year they were assessed on the MCAS. I would like to examine the relationship between a student’s performance as measured by their teachers compared to their performance level as measured by the state. Are their patterns to the groups of students with the largest discrepancy between these two metrics? This would be important data to support the teaching and learning at our school.</p>
<p>On a broader scale, I think that I need to develop a stronger sense for what summary statistics are the most meaningful for a given variable to identify potential trends or insights and subsequently what visualizations best convey these insights to a reader. I would also like to develop a tool-kit of best practices for “checking against my own biases”. What set of metrics can I perform to best control for my potential mistakes as a human being with a limited perspective?</p>

This suggests that we should dedicate more classroom instructional time to problem solving with calculation. Notably, the higher a student's performance level, the higher the percentage of points a student lost for calculation items. The largest area of growth for students across all performance categories is on calculation based items; evidence based math interventions include small group, differentiated problem sets.</span>

Differentiated, tiered, small group problem sets in the general classroom setting could potentially address the "calculation gap".</span>

<span id="cb41-1096"><a href="#cb41-1096" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I was inspired to work on this report after years of experience working at a public school. Public education is a sector that is filled with passion and positive intentions but also divisive discussions. There exist a plethora of simplistic "one-trick fixes" that are marketed to students, teachers, and families. The use of data is the best tool we have against pressing forward and investing our precious time and money with initiatives that do not improve student outcomes. </span>

<span id="cb41-1098"><a href="#cb41-1098" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Over the years, I've noticed that teachers and leaders are given annual data reports yet, most lack the time, capacity, or resources to identify evidence based, actionable measures to enact in the classroom or at the organizational level. When presented with all of the questions from an assessment individually and the performance of all of one's students on paper, it is difficult to identify trends. Anecdotally, I have noticed every year the majority of teachers gravitating to the scores and performance of individual students that they previously taught and ascribing mistakes or successes to specific experiences with an individual or one word in a question prompt. While relationship building and teaching to a child are hallmarks to student-teacher relationships, a narrow lens like this will not allow a teacher to identify classroom level changes or curriculum level changes that could impact all students and future students. In one's compassionate focus on individuals, a great opportunity to promote the learning for all students is lost.</span>

<span id="cb41-1100"><a href="#cb41-1100" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With the use of R, and the MCAS reports, I decided to focus on ways to identify trends at the classroom or curricular level. I found it challenging to limit the scope of my work for this project. Also, I struggled with discerning when to use <span class="in">`sum`</span> vs. when to use <span class="in">`averages`</span> or <span class="in">`medians`</span>. To improve a student's performance on a test, we are concerned with total points lost and relative weight of a content category; to identify curricular weaknesses we are also interested in relative performance to the state by content area.</span>

<span id="cb41-1102"><a href="#cb41-1102" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I only completed the analysis of the Introductory Physics Exam for High school students. I have <span class="in">`ELA`</span>, <span class="in">`Math`</span>, and <span class="in">`Science`</span> results for grades 5-8 as well as grade 10. I am still working on building a general function library to generate similar graphics and tables for other content areas and grade levels and I would like to complete a similar report for each grade level and subject area assessment for teachers to use.</span>
<span id="cb41-1103"><a href="#cb41-1103" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb41-1104"><a href="#cb41-1104" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Given access to historical data, I think it would be beneficial to examine these trends over time to discern the performance gaps attributable to changes in the population of students (a factor which we cannot control or change) vs. those attributable to curriculum and teaching (an area we can influence and effect change).</span>
<span id="cb41-1105"><a href="#cb41-1105" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb41-1106"><a href="#cb41-1106" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I also have access to reports that include the teacher a student had and the grades they earned from their teacher in the year they were assessed on the MCAS. I would like to examine the relationship between a student's performance as measured by their teachers compared to their performance level as measured by the state. Are their patterns to the groups of students with the largest discrepancy between these two metrics? This would be important data to support the teaching and learning at our school.</span>
<span id="cb41-1107"><a href="#cb41-1107" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb41-1108"><a href="#cb41-1108" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>On a broader scale, I think that I need to develop a stronger sense for what summary statistics are the most meaningful for a given variable to identify potential trends or insights and subsequently what visualizations best convey these insights to a reader. I would  also like to develop a tool-kit of best practices for "checking against my own biases". What set of metrics can I perform to best control for my potential mistakes as a human being with a limited perspective?</span>
